"""Tests for PR 3: `GET /feed/<id>` no longer blocks on `refresh_feed`.

The route used to issue a synchronous upstream RSS fetch on every reader
poll, which made feed-fetch latency upstream-bounded. PR 3 drops that
synchronous call and instead kicks off a debounced refresh on a background
thread (when not already kicked off recently). The scheduled
`refresh_all_feeds` job remains the primary freshness source.
